              How much does AC repair cost in Huntsville, AL?

            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>AC repair costs in Huntsville typically range from <strong>$75–$500</strong> for common repairs like refrigerant recharge, capacitor replacement, or contactor replacement. Compressor replacement can run <strong>$800–$2,000+</strong> depending on the unit. Coil replacement or full system failure can exceed $3,000, at which point replacement often makes more financial sense.</p>
              <p style="margin-top:12px;">We always provide a written diagnosis and price quote before starting any work. You decide whether to proceed — no pressure.</p>

            <button class="faq-item__question">
              How do I know if I should repair or replace my AC?
              <img src="images/icons/chevron-down.svg" alt="">
            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>Use the <strong>"5,000 rule"</strong>: multiply the repair cost by the age of your unit in years. If the result exceeds $5,000, replacement is usually the smarter investment.</p>
              <p style="margin-top:12px;"><strong>Example:</strong> $800 repair × 10-year-old unit = $8,000 → lean toward replacement.<br>$200 repair × 5-year-old unit = $1,000 → repair makes sense.</p>
              <p style="margin-top:12px;">Also consider: if your system is over 15 years old, uses R-22 refrigerant (now discontinued), or has had multiple major repairs in the past 3 years, replacement is almost always the right call.</p>

              What size AC unit do I need for my Huntsville home?

            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>In Alabama's hot, humid climate, proper sizing is critical — and it's more complex than "one ton per 400 sq ft." As a rough estimate, plan for approximately <strong>1 ton of cooling per 400–600 sq ft</strong>, but many factors affect this:</p>
              <ul style="margin:12px 0 0 0;list-style:disc;padding-left:24px;color:var(--text-light);line-height:2;">
                <li>Ceiling height (vaulted ceilings need more capacity)</li>
                <li>Insulation quality</li>
                <li>Number and size of windows</li>
                <li>Shade and sun exposure</li>
                <li>Number of occupants</li>
                <li>Duct condition and layout</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-top:12px;">We perform a <strong>Manual J load calculation</strong> on every installation — it's the only accurate way to size a system. An oversized AC won't dehumidify properly (a major issue in Alabama), and an undersized system will run constantly and fail early.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-item__question">
              How often should I service my HVAC system in Alabama?

            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>We recommend <strong>two professional tune-ups per year</strong>:</p>
              <ul style="margin:12px 0;list-style:disc;padding-left:24px;color:var(--text-light);line-height:2;">
                <li><strong>Spring (March–April):</strong> Pre-season AC inspection before Huntsville's brutal summer heat arrives</li>
                <li><strong>Fall (October–November):</strong> Heating system check before cold snaps hit North Alabama</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Alabama's long summers (AC runs May through October) put extreme wear on systems. Regular maintenance extends system life by 3–5 years and helps you avoid emergency breakdowns when temps hit 95°F.</p>

              Do HVAC contractors in Alabama need to be licensed?

            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>Yes — Alabama requires HVAC contractors to hold a license through the <strong>Alabama Licensing Board for General Contractors</strong> (ALBGC). This includes installation, replacement, and repair of heating, cooling, and ventilation systems.</p>
              <p style="margin-top:12px;">Always verify a contractor's license before hiring. Unlicensed HVAC work can void your equipment warranty and create liability issues if something goes wrong.</p>
              <p style="margin-top:12px;"><strong>Huntsville HVAC Pros</strong> holds full HVAC contractor licensing and carries comprehensive general liability and workers' compensation insurance on every job.</p>

            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>This is the most common HVAC complaint in summer. Common causes include:</p>
              <ul style="margin:12px 0;list-style:disc;padding-left:24px;color:var(--text-light);line-height:2;">
                <li><strong>Low refrigerant</strong> — often from a slow leak; the system runs but can't cool effectively</li>
                <li><strong>Frozen evaporator coil</strong> — usually caused by dirty filter or low refrigerant; restricts airflow</li>
                <li><strong>Dirty condenser coils</strong> — outdoor unit can't reject heat properly in Alabama's humidity</li>
                <li><strong>Failed capacitor</strong> — common in our climate; causes the compressor or fan motor to stop</li>
                <li><strong>Compressor failure</strong> — the most expensive failure; often means replacement</li>
                <li><strong>Duct leaks</strong> — cooled air escaping into the attic or crawlspace</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Call us at (256) 215-9287 for same-day diagnosis. Most of these are quick, affordable fixes when caught early.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>Yes. We offer flexible financing options for system replacements and large repairs. Ask about <strong>0% interest promotional plans</strong> and low monthly payment options when you request your free estimate. A new Carrier or Trane system typically runs $4,000–$8,000 installed — financing makes this very manageable.</p>

              <p style="margin-top:12px;">We understand that an AC failure at midnight in August in Alabama is a genuine emergency — especially with elderly family members, young children, or pets in the home. We take emergency calls seriously and respond within hours.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>A standard residential AC or heat pump replacement (same location, no ductwork changes) takes <strong>4–8 hours</strong> for most systems. Larger homes or complex installations may take a full day. We remove and haul away the old equipment and leave your home clean.</p>
              <p style="margin-top:12px;">We schedule installations as quickly as possible — during peak summer season, same-week appointments are common. Emergency replacements (complete system failure) are prioritized.</p>

              What is the best HVAC brand for Alabama's climate?

            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>All major brands — Carrier, Trane, Lennox, Goodman — perform well in Alabama when properly sized and installed. Our honest take:</p>
              <ul style="margin:12px 0;list-style:disc;padding-left:24px;color:var(--text-light);line-height:2;">
                <li><strong>Carrier:</strong> Excellent reliability and efficiency; our most-installed brand</li>
                <li><strong>Trane:</strong> Very durable; premium price but strong long-term value</li>
                <li><strong>Lennox:</strong> Highest efficiency ratings; great for homeowners focused on energy savings</li>
                <li><strong>Goodman:</strong> Solid value with good warranty; best budget-to-quality ratio</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The installer matters more than the brand. A poorly installed Carrier will underperform a well-installed Goodman every time.</p>
